      <h3>Accessibility in a nutshell</h3>
      <p>
        Accessibility is one of the most discussed topics in modern frontend
        applications nowadays. It is defined as the practice of making websites
        usable by everyone. Although accessibility is often overlooked, it is an
        important part, if not a vital part of maintaining a successful website.
        After all, consider that a website that is accessible to a larger range
        of users will get more views than one that isnâ€™t.
